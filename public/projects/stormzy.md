<h1 class="page-title">stormzy</h1>

The large-sized, photorealistic, acrylic series was created in an attempt to capture the atmosphere conveyed by a person, whilst limiting myself to a monochrome color set.

	The project started out with sketches in blue and purple; whilst the first attempt, _monelle_, does not capture the emotion of the captured person strongly enough, the melancholic temper does come through in the sketches _julia_ and _henry_, despite the simplification and broad brushstrokes.

	The first main work is based on a photograph of the rapper Stormzy (Michael Omari), which is also the reason for the name of the series. It is painted in shades of dark blue and green. _omari_ inspired me to draw another portrait which is based on Julian Klincewicz that is currently a work in progress. The two main works are titled after the last names of the pictured subjects, and the sketches after the first names.

	Even though the two portraits convey different emotion, the premise of creating a different picture using similar a color set was intriguing to me, firstly, because it creates a link in my work and more importantly  because it allows me to explore and display how the same monochrome color set can create two images that are perceived entirely different by the beholder.
